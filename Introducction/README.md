# Introduction to Groovy
----
## What's Groovy?
**Groovy** is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine (_JVM_).
It's inspired in languages like Ruby, Python and Java (of course).
Learning curve from Java to Groovy it's almost-zero! 
It implements some features that Java 8 has just implemented, like Functional Programming and the Closure term.
## Who is using Groovy?
Many enterprises and startups are using **Groovy**, **Grails**, **Gradle** or **Griffon** which are the most important related projects to Groovy.
Actually at [Grails](https://grails.org/) website you can find a lot of examples of who's using Groovy, let's just mention some of them:

* Netflix
* Linked-In
* Cisco
* Nestle
* Vodafone

## Why should I use Groovy?

Groovy is not just another **"Java's son"**, Groovy uses the JVM to exploit all it's power! Groovy has been used for 11 years! It's not a n00b language, it helps you to develop easy apps using the whole JVM environment, libraries and tweaks from Java! Why do we have to start over? Let's just use all those years of engineering applied and start enjoying all it's power!
